What this plugin does, is ranks a player up using LuckPerms after a certain number of playtime. You must install PlayTimePlus, availble here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/playtimeplus-1-8-1-15-2.72533/.

To install:
1. Make sure you have LuckPerms on the Spigot/Paper servers, and connect them using MySQL if BungeeCord
2. Configure the MySQL settings for PlayTimePlus if BungeeCord.
3. Install PlayTimeRankup (this plugin) on all servers, but not the BungeeCord if applicable.
4. Open the config.yml in the folder PlayTimeRankup. Config is pretty self explanatory.
